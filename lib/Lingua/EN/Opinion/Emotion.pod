NRC EMOTION LEXICON
-------------------
The NRC emotion lexicon is a list of words and their associations with
eight emotions (anger, fear, anticipation, trust, surprise, sadness,
joy, and disgust) and two sentiments (negative and positive). The
annotations were manually done through Amazon's Mechanical Turk. Refer
to publications below for more details.
